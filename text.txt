These three Git commands are used to **track, save, and upload your changes to GitHub**. Hereâ€™s what each one does:  

### **1. `git add .`**  
âœ… **Stages all modified and new files** for commit.  
- It tells Git to track all changes in the current project directory.  

### **2. `git commit -m "Your update message"`**  
âœ… **Saves the changes** to your local Git repository.  
- The `-m "Your update message"` adds a meaningful message describing what you changed.  

### **3. `git push origin LUFFY`**  
âœ… **Uploads (pushes) the committed changes** to GitHub.  
- `origin` refers to your remote repository on GitHub.  
- `LUFFY` is the branch where you are pushing the changes.

âœ… **Fetches and merges changes** from the remote repository to your local repository.  
- Ensures your local repository is up-to-date with the latest changes from the LUFFY branch.

### **2. `git checkout -b your-branch-name`**  
âœ… **Creates and switches to a new branch** for your work.  
- Helps in keeping your changes isolated from the LUFFY branch until they are ready to be merged.

### **3. `git add .`**  
âœ… **Stages all modified and new files** for commit.  
- It tells Git to track all changes in the current project directory.

### **4. `git commit -m "Your update message"`**  
âœ… **Saves the changes** to your local Git repository.  
- The `-m "Your update message"` adds a meaningful message describing what you changed.

### **5. `git push origin your-branch-name`**  
âœ… **Uploads (pushes) the committed changes** to GitHub.  
- `origin` refers to your remote repository on GitHub.  
- `your-branch-name` is the branch where you are pushing the changes.

### **6. Create a Pull Request on GitHub**  
âœ… **Propose your changes** to be merged into the LUFFY branch.  
- Allows other collaborators to review and approve your changes before merging.

ðŸ’¡ **Use these commands every time you start working on a collaborative project!** ðŸš€

### **Handling Non-Fast-Forward Errors:**
